# ATM-Fluid-Web-Interface
Heavily javascript focused ATM interface presented in browser format.
My goal was to create a simple ATM interface that didn't require reloading/switching pages, so heavy use of javascript was implemented.
CSS was also heavily used to ensure all the containers and UI is seamless, clean and does not produce visible issues. /n
